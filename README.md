  <h1> Hey y'all my name is Sophia Garza, welcome to my site! </h1>
  <br/><b/> Get to know all about me <b/><br/>
  <p> I am currently a Freshman at The University of Texas studying supply chain managment in the McCombs School of Business.
    I love Austin! Some of my favorite thinsg to do are:
  <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
 <li/> Hang out with my friends (I'm in Texas Royals)
 <li/> Hike at Barton Creek
<li/> Watch Texas sports (big Texas Football girl)
 <li/> And of course sit in and learn MIS from the best professor out there (I'm looking at you Professor Anand)
     </ul>
After college I hope to go to law school and study to become a defense attorney. Until then I am here at UT and I coudln't be more excited about that! Can't wait to see what the next few years have in store for me. </p>
