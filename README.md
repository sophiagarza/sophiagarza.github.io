  <h1> Hey y'all my name is Sophia Garza, welcome to my site! </h1>
  <br/><b/> Get to know all about me <b/><br/>
  <p> I am currently a Freshman at The University of Texas studying supply chain managment in the McCombs School of Business.
    I love Austin! Some of my favorite thinsg to do are:
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
   <li/> Hang out with my friends (I'm in Texas Royals)
 <li/> hike at Barton Creek
  <li/> Watch Texas sports (big Texas Football girl)
  <li/> and of course sit in and learn MIS from the best professor out there (I'm looking at you Professor Anand)
      </li></ul>
